**Last Updated: November 16, 2025**
**Version: 3.0.0**

## Introduction

Safe Home Button ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Android application.

## Developer Information

- **App Name**: Safe Home Button
- **Developer**: Stephan Heuscher
- **Contact Email**: stv.heuscher@gmail.com
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Stephan-Heuscher/Save-Home-Button

## Data Collection and Usage

### Information We DO NOT Collect

Safe Home Button itself **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal information or user data. The app:

- Does not collect your name, email, or contact information
- Does not track your location
- Does not record your screen or app usage
- Does not access your contacts, photos, or other personal files
- Does not monitor which apps you use or how you use them
- **Does not use advertising ID** - We explicitly exclude advertising identifiers
- Does not contain any advertising or analytics libraries
- Does not share any data with third parties

### Information Stored Locally

The app stores the following settings **only on your device**:

- Position of the floating navigation dot (as screen percentage)
- Selected color preferences (RGB values)
- Opacity/transparency settings (0-255 alpha value)
- Activation status (on/off)
- Tap behavior mode (Safe Home or Navi)
- Keyboard avoidance preference (on/off)
- Recent apps switch timeout (milliseconds)
- Screen dimensions and rotation state

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any server
- Is only accessible by the app itself
- Is stored in Android's secure SharedPreferences
- Is automatically deleted when you uninstall the app
- Cannot be accessed by other apps

## Permissions Explained

### 1. Display Over Other Apps (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW)

**Purpose**: Allows the app to display the floating navigation dot on top of other apps.

**What We Access**: Only the ability to draw a small circular button on your screen.

**What We DON'T Do**: We do not read, record, or access content from other apps. We only display our navigation dot.

### 2. Accessibility Service

**Purpose**: Enables navigation actions (back, home, recent apps, app switching).

**What We Access**: Minimal system functions needed for navigation gestures only.

**What We DON'T Do**: 
- We do NOT read or record screen content
- We do NOT log your activities
- We do NOT access text from other apps
- We do NOT monitor which apps you use
- We do NOT transmit any accessibility data

**Important**: The accessibility service is used exclusively for executing navigation commands when you tap the floating dot. It has no ability to collect or transmit data.

### 3. Run at Startup (RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED)

**Purpose**: Allows the app to start automatically after device restart (if you had it enabled).

**What We Access**: Notification when the device boots up.

**What We DON'T Do**: We do not collect any boot-related data or device information.

### 4. Foreground Service

**Purpose**: Keeps the floating navigation dot visible and responsive while you use other apps.

**What We Access**: Permission to run a persistent service with a notification.

**What We DON'T Do**: The service only manages the overlay button and does not collect, monitor, or transmit any data.

**Note**: A persistent notification is required by Android when the app is active. This is a system requirement, not a tracking mechanism.

### 5. Post Notifications (Android 13+)

**Purpose**: Display the required foreground service notification.

**What We Access**: Ability to show a notification that the app is running.

**What We DON'T Do**: We do not send promotional notifications, reminders, or any other messages. The notification only indicates the app is active.
